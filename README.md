# Sumary

Hi, my name is Nguyen Huu Chau.

And this is my side project link [Netflix clone](https://movie-and-tv-display-clone.vercel.app/)

It illustrates all the movie and tv series content and can access to watch it.

## Tech Stack:

- For the frontend, I am using ReactJS along with Bootstrap CSS to build a fully Responsive website.
- For the data, I use API key from [The Movie database (TMDB)](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference) to fetch the data and with the help of Postman, I can get the required information for illustration.
- For web deployment, I use Vercel to display the web contents and features.

## Detail Design

### 1. Requirement:
In order to build a Responsive Movie display system that shows different types of movies and tv-series. Which includes:

- Feature 1 : carousel now playing & upcoming movies
- Feature 2 : searching movies, tv shows, actors by the name
- Feature 3 : detail movies, tv shows
- Feature 4 : watch trailer movies & tv shows

### 2. Component Structure
Here is the component structure of the website i made.



## What I learned:

  From building the Movie display website, I got to have a large ammount of understanding about React Route and its concept, along with the principle of API GET methods.

- Deep understands about **Components** and **Component interactions**.
- Deep understands about **React Route** and related **Route hooks** (useLoaderData, useLocation, etc).
- Know how to **destructure an object state** and pass it to the **Parent** or **Child** component.
- Basic understanding of **axios and async awaits** to fetch the data and change the parameter input.
- Learn the **flows of the website** so as to **handle the error** more **efficiency**.
- Learn how to **fetch data with url parameters** to perform tasks (use it as a parameter to fetch the data required, use the value to display the content of the website)
  
## Future updates:

  This website has all the basic requirement of a Weather Report website.

- Adding animation such as the animation of the current weather (sunny, rain) in the background for better User experience
- Adding searching feature that zoning the closest input value and diplay it into a drop down list. This will require an understanding of backend coding. Which is why I have plans to learn Nodejs to make it happen.
- Change the "Submit Location" button into "Current Location" as we will click directly on the drop list to display that city's weather status
- Adding features to convert the tempreture from °C to °F, as well as convering km/h into mph/h
- Create a navigation bar with Home that display the content of the website and Saved city that store the city's weather status you saved and display it on the Home page.
- I have plans of learning React Native in order to deploy a true app, not just a website.
- I want to display the data of the area the user is standing which will require google maps api from the users.
